# nosDB

nosDB is a NoSQL database library. It works on key value pairs to store and retrieve the data.


## Quickstart

Instantiate the Database class by passing the file name of the database.
```
from src import nosdb
object_name = nosdb.Database("filename")
```

Now, predefined methods can be used for interacting with the database.

Refer test.py for more details.
